---This repository hosts code dedicated to my eperience in ML 6070. The files need to be run in Python and are sourced from my Machine Learning class.
Download the notebooks, open them on you preferred python program and then run all the code to see the outputs. I am currenly useing Jupyter Lab Notebook
3.3.2. Runtime should be about 4 seconds for the entire file, unless otherwise noted.---

CA03 - In this notebook I ingest provided census data and go through steps to analyze the it, build a Decision Tree model, and tune it according the BEST
hyperameters for making the model the best predictor. This code takes approximately 40 seconds to run in JuypterLab and yielded an accuracy score of 84%.

You can find the data below:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-03-Decision-Trees/master/census_data.csv


The training, test, and emails are locaed in the file data.zip, within my repository for reference. 

The libraries and source for the data are below:

Install these libraries before running your code
!pip install --upgrade pip
!pip install scikit-learn 
!pip install numpy
!pip install pandas
!pip install ydata-quality
!pip install six
!pip install graphviz
!pip install pydotplus

Make sure to import these at the beginning
