CA06: KMeans Clustering - This notebook is focused on creating a KMeans Clustering machine learning model to identify clusters / segment groups amongst mall customers
in the dataset. Using the variables Spending Scoare and Annual Income, the optimal number of clusters were determined using the silhoutte score, which resulted in
5 clusters. Each of the five customer groups ranged from customers that had low - high spending scores and low - high annual income. The intracluster and intercluster
similarities show that the clusters are good clusters, while a few (mentioned in the notebook) are undoubtedly, slightly better clusters than others. 

Using this analysis, I would reccomend that stakeholders become more familiar with their customer segments by giving them names, leanrning more about
their characteristics, and discuss where they would most like to optimizie profit - low spenders or high spenders. It's important to note that there would be different
marketing implications for each; though, there market research should be done for the groups the mall is most intersted. 

It took me 50 seconds to run this entire notebook.
