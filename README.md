# Machine-Learning-Course-6070
This repository hosts code dedicated to my eperience in ML 6070. The files need to be run in Python and are sourced from my Machine Learning class. Download the notebooks, open them on you preferred python program and then run all the code to see the outputs. I am currenly useing Jupyter Lab Notebook 3.3.2. Runtime should be about 4 seconds for the entire file, unless otherwise noted.
