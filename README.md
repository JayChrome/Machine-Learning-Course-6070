# Machine-Learning-Course-6070
This repository hosts code dedicated to my eperience in ML 6070. The files need to be run in Python. Download the notebooks, open them on you preferred python program and then run all the code to see the outputs. Runtime should be about 4 seconds for the entire file. 

<b>CA01</b> - is exemplary of an exploraty data analysis (EDA) for House Price Dataset. All steps of EDA are included besides collinearity, dimensionality reduction, and handle class imbalance. 

<b>CA02</b> - This partuclar code is focused on creating an email spam filter for emails and measuring the accuracy of the model through Naive Bayes. This code takes approximately 80 seconds to run on python lab and yeilds an accuracy score of 1.0. Meaning that the model correctly predicted classiicaions 100% of the time.
